# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
i wanted to switch from using swing to the more modern and easy to use javaFX, plus I always wanted to code this, so far my favorite side project

currently load and save doesnt work, i want to implement a drawing system where you can set up your own initial cell setup
instead of doing random cells
